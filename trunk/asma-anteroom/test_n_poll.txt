
asma-anteroom\module\UNCERTAIN\David Spilka (Datri)\cmc\..
A shared uncertain for all files in the folder is similarity to ASMA sap (or any orginal music not sap'ed yet).
My propose (marok) is if similarity sap exists decide what to do next with the module - because that's not 'one way traffic', if it not exists it's more clear and the door to ASMA collection is basically open.

sim? - yes, http://asma.atari.org/asma/Composers/Kalinowski_Bartosz/Sweet_Illusions_Effects_2.sap
marok: I need some more comparisions but my first thought when I have matched them - no.

marok: I think is a chance (but I'm not sure) the last pattern is cut, but it's not 'big' problem in this one, I suppose.

marok: I'd see this remix in ASMA (quite different than orginal and nice).

*\asma-anteroom\sap\..


Arcade_Fruit_Machine.TIME_MISS.sap
ok?


D-Bug.TIME_MISS.sap
it's too complicate for pure rip to me, main problem is i hear it's bit diffrent sounds than in game - flatter? - (i don't really know why)
beside subs.2&3 which are expected to sound diffrent (due $d20a in play)
subs.6-8 haven't detected in game and because music in the prod are composited i had to guess them (i have matched 5 components to 3 songs)


Desert_Falcon.TIME_MISS.sap, Desert_Falcon.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
marok: seems to me (as I hear it) there is clipped sound in all short subsongs in sap with declares TIME done (*_TIME_SHORT-WARNING).


Dr_Seuss.TIME_MISS.sap, Dr_Seuss.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
case Desert_Falcon.*.sap


Dragonriders_of_Perm.TIME_MISS.sap, *.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap, *.TIME_MISS__SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap, *.TIME_SHORT-WARNING__SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap
case Desert_Falcon.*.sap plus problem of subsongs not used in game at two additional saps (*__SUBSONG_OVER)
marok: this particular case with overtime subsongs is quite ease, because these are unattractive and two of them also extremly short, but in general I think, not used subsongs in game should be considered to sap (this one title is delivered as an example only).


Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_1.sap, Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_2.sap
eventually can join specific sap but is rather questionable it is worth for.


Ducks_Ahoy.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap, Ducks_Ahoy.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
not sure which of these two choose to ASMA (short subsongs are doubtly interesting)


Fidget.SUBSONGS_INCLUDE(1).sap
alternative version with additional subsong (can eventually replace current asma-version)


Floyd_of_the_Jungle.MUSIC_ONLY.sap, *.TIME_MISS.sap, *.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
task of version to choose to asma (*TIME_MISS.sap not counts for it)


Gangway.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
ok (mean to asma with it)? or reduce subsongs? (all or which of them)

Ice.sap
A music quality doubt.

Into_the_Eagles_Nest.sap
A music quality doubt.

Jawbreaker.sap
Not too short nor fairly interesting?

Kangaroo.sap
Music's duration is very short, additional in the production there is one more if I'm correct (even shorter) piece of music (either not sfx) not contained in the sap.

Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.sap
ok?
