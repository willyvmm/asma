A music quality doubt.


000cff13.MMMG_soft_demo.#CENSORED#(Marek Goderski(MMMG),1992).cmc
I'm explaining used fraze #CENSORED# here - it's about original name of this module (very long, but what importante, highly controversial IMO).
A music quality (a little rather) doubt.

asma-anteroom\module\UNCERTAIN\David Spilka (Datri)\cmc\..
A shared uncertain for all files in the folder is similarity to ASMA sap (or any orginal music not sap'ed yet).
My propose (marok) is if similarity sap exists decide what to do next with the module - because that's not 'one way traffic', if it not exists it's more clear and the door to ASMA collection is basically open.

Arcade_Fruit_Machine.TIME_MISS.sap
ok?


Bugrunner.TIME_MISS.sap
Very quiet sound of music.
Play 2. or 3. subsong leads to play 1. subsong after it's end.


D-Bug.TIME_MISS.sap
it's too complicate for pure rip to me, main problem is i hear it's bit diffrent sounds than in game - flatter? - (i don't really know why)
beside subs.2&3 which are expected to sound diffrent (due $d20a in play)
subs.6-8 haven't detected in game and because music in the prod are composited i had to guess them (i have matched 5 components to 3 songs)

Question about existing subsongs. MOVED INTO ASMA NOW.


Dragonriders_of_Perm.SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap
Problem of subsongs not used in game at *.SUBSONG_OVER
marok: this particular case with overtime subsongs is quite ease, because these are unattractive and two of them also extremly short, but in general I think, not used subsongs in game should be considered to sap (this one title is delivered as an EXAMPLE ONLY).


Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_1.sap, Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_2.sap
Eventually can join specific sap but is rather questionable it is worth for.


Ducks_Ahoy.sap
Question about existing subsongs. MOVED INTO ASMA NOW.


Ducks_Ahoy.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
Alternative version.


Fidget.SUBSONGS_INCLUDE(1).sap
Alternative version with additional subsong (can eventually replace current asma-version)


Floyd_of_the_Jungle.ALL_SOUND.sap, Floyd_of_the_Jungle.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
Waiting for decision of choise between versions.


Gangway.ALL_SOUND.sap
Question about existing subsongs.


Ice.sap
A music quality doubt.


Into_the_Eagles_Nest.sap
A music quality doubt.


Jawbreaker.sap
Not too short nor fairly interesting? MOVED INTO ASMA NOW. (Positive opinion)


Kangaroo.sap
Music's duration is very short, additional in the production there is one more if I'm correct (even shorter) piece of music (either not sfx) not contained in the sap.


Mission_die.sap
In the production this music sounds diffrent but is also quite buggy in my opinion (eg loop causes Async in melody by shifting two parts in relationship to each other).
In the sap it is corrected, but I must mention not all music is taken (I miss some).


Olde_Gold.sap
A music quality doubt.


Return_of_Heracles.ALL_SOUND.sap
Question about existing subsongs.


Seahorses.ALL_SOUND.sap

ok?

All sap files here are from "Beep'em All 3". They have corrected time indications now.
Should or not be placed in ASMA?
