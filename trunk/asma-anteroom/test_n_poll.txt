
asma-anteroom\module\UNCERTAIN\David Spilka (Datri)\cmc\..
A shared uncertain for all files in the folder is similarity to ASMA sap (or any orginal music not sap'ed yet).
My propose (marok) is if similarity sap exists decide what to do next with the module - because that's not 'one way traffic', if it not exists it's more clear and the door to ASMA collection is basically open.

sim? - yes, http://asma.atari.org/asma/Composers/Kalinowski_Bartosz/Sweet_Illusions_Effects_2.sap
marok: I need some more comparisions but my first thought when I have matched them - no.

marok: I think is a chance (but I'm not sure) the last pattern is cut, but it's not 'big' problem in this one, I suppose.

marok: I'd see this remix in ASMA (quite different than orginal and nice).

*\asma-anteroom\sap\..


Arcade_Fruit_Machine.TIME_MISS.sap
ok?


Desert_Falcon.TIME_MISS.sap, Desert_Falcon.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
marok: seems to me (as I hear it) there is clipped sound in all short subsongs in sap with declares TIME done (*_TIME_SHORT-WARNING).


Dr_Seuss.TIME_MISS.sap, Dr_Seuss.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap
case Desert_Falcon.*.sap


Dragonriders_of_Perm.TIME_MISS.sap, *.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap, *.TIME_MISS__SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap, *.TIME_SHORT-WARNING__SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap
case Desert_Falcon.*.sap plus problem of subsongs not used in game at two additional saps (*__SUBSONG_OVER)
marok: this particular case with overtime subsongs is quite ease, because these are unattractive and two of them also extremly short, but in general I think, not used subsongs in game should be considered to sap (this one title is delivered as an example only).


Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_1.sap, Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_2.sap
eventually can join specific sap but is rather questionable it is worth for.


Ducks_Ahoy.TIME_SHORT-WARNING.sap, Ducks_Ahoy.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
not sure which of these two choose to ASMA (short subsongs are doubtly interesting)


Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.sap
ok?
