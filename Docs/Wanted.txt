At the time we are searching for these tunes:

Richard Munns:
Crumble's Crisis, Rebound, Space Lobsters, any other tunes...

Fred Brooker
Microx, Lemmintro, Balleantro, Vaxeen, Digisynth, Rabbacan, Brutal Recall
Demo, any other tunes...
(Unfortunately most of these titles aren't probably converted to PC disk
images. I've got them on my T2000 tapes but many of them had some kind of copy
protection.)

David Whittaker
Electra Glide, any other tunes

Peter Liepa
Boulder Dash I & II

Unknown composers:
Decathlon, Gyrrus, Megablast, Zeppelin, Zorro, any other tunes...

If we talk about "any other tunes" we mean only the tunes that aren't already
included in ASMA (except some better rips or tunes with more subtunes
inside).
