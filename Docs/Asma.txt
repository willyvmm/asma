 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is the release version of the first Atari XL/XE chip-music collection.
 The outfit of the whole collection was inspired by the HVSC collection (with 
 some differences). I hope you'll like this collection. To get in touch with 
 me, see the "Contact" section of this document.

 Help!
 ~~~~~
 As you can see, there are lots of tunes in the 'Unsorted' directory. If
 you're 100% sure about origin of any of these tunes (Who did it, where does 
 it come from, when was it composed), please let us know immediately so that 
 we can complete the information about the tune in ASMA (and move it to the 
 appropriate directory). We would welcome if you sent us also the binary file 
 (or an ATR/XFD disk image) with the original piece of software with that 
 tune. Mail any such information to pg@dspaudio.com. Our aim is to completely 
 annihilate the unrecognized tunes.


 For contributors
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you want to send me some tunes, they should be already converted to SAP
 format and should include all the information needed (author, name, date,
 number of songs). If you're unsure about any information needed, you can
 send me the music as well, maybe we can find the info together. If you don't
 know how to create SAP files, send me the binary file with the INIT and PLAY
 addresses and memory location where the tune has to be loaded. See Sap.txt
 for SAP format description. The filenames must not be longer than 26
 characters (plus .sap) e.g.:

 12345678901234567890123456.123
 Intel_Outside_Fractal_Part.sap - all right
 Jocky_Wilsons_Darts_Compendium.sap - wrong!

 Because of compatibility reasons only characters 'A..Z', 'a..z', and '0..9'
 can be used in the filenames. All spaces must be replaced with underscore
 ("_"). The dash ("-") is also allowed but from no reason we don't use it :-)
