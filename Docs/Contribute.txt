This file gives all the information needed for those who want to send songs
to ASMA archive.

If you want to send me some tunes, they should be already converted to SAP
format and should include all the information needed (author, name, date,
number of songs). If you're unsure about any information needed, you can
send me the music as well, maybe we can find the info together. If you don't
know how to create SAP files, send me the binary file with the INIT and PLAY
addresses and memory location where the tune has to be loaded. See Sap.txt
for SAP format description.

Information needed (or welcome)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Author of the song
- Name of song
- Date of creation or copyright date
- Number of subsongs/default subsong
For SAP files this information should be already included in the header, for
other fileformats write it into a separate textfile.

STIL information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This information is not essential but if you know anything of these, please 
send it together with the song.
- Name of covered song (plus album)
- Name of the interpreter (singer, band) or composer
If the song is a demoparty music compo contribution, send us the name of the
party (including year) and the final standing of the song (only for songs
that ended at 1st, 2nd or 3rd place).
Again you can write all this information into a separate text file.
Examples:

Digital_Trash.sap
  TITLE: Domino Dancing [from Introspective]
 ARTIST: Pet Shop Boys

Desastre.sap
COMMENT: 2nd place at Intel Outside 4 music compo.

SAP header conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The filenames must not be longer than 26 characters (plus .sap) e.g.:

 12345678901234567890123456.123
 Intel_Outside_Fractal_Part.sap - all right
 Jocky_Wilsons_Darts_Compendium.sap - wrong!

Because of compatibility reasons only characters 'A..Z', 'a..z', and '0..9'
can be used in the filenames. All spaces must be replaced with underscore
("_"). The dash ("-") is also allowed but from no reason we don't use it :-)

All tags in SAP header must be UPPERCASE (e.g. AUTHOR, DATE). The field
contents must be closed in quotation marks ("). There is one SPACE ( )
between the tag and the quotation mark.
Every line in the header must end with EOL ($0d $0a).
For unknown information use this mark <?>.
For more information about the SAP header see the file Sap.txt.
Example:

SAP
AUTHOR "Marek Badkowski (Bac)"
NAME "Deafman"
DATE "<?>"
TYPE B
INIT 0500
PLAYER F092

If possible, send also the original file/game/demo that you ripped the
song(s) from.

Thanks for your contributions!
