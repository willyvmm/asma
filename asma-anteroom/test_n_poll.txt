asma-anteroom\module\UNCERTAIN\..
A shared uncertain for all files in the folder is similarity to ASMA sap (or any orginal music not sap'ed yet).
My propose (marok) is if similarity sap exists decide what to do next with the module - because that's not 'one way traffic', if it not exists it's more clear and the door to ASMA collection is basically open.

marok: I need some more comparisions but my first thought when I have matched them - no.

marok: I think is a chance (but I'm not sure) the last pattern is cut, but it's not 'big' problem in this one, I suppose.

marok: I'd see this remix in ASMA (quite different than orginal and nice).

\asma-anteroom\sap\..


AD_2044_Sexmisja.ALL_SOUND__TIME_MISS.sap
Alt. version.


Advanced_Pinball_Simulator.ALL_SOUND__TIME_MISS.sap
Needs some extra work on it (maybe size optimalization or at least solve ending part of subsongs). Also there are very-very similar subsongs in sap and one doublet.


Arcade_Fruit_Machine.sap
Please test it (some very short sub-musics).


Bugrunner.TIME_MISS.sap
Very quiet sound of music.
Play 2. or 3. subsong leads to play 1. subsong after it's end.


D-Bug.TIME_MISS.sap
it's too complicate for pure rip to me, main problem is i hear it's bit diffrent sounds than in game - flatter? - (i don't really know why)
beside subs.2&3 which are expected to sound diffrent (due $d20a in play)
subs.6-8 haven't detected in game and because music in the prod are composited i had to guess them (i have matched 5 components to 3 songs)


Dragonriders_of_Perm.SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap
Problem of subsongs not used in game at *.SUBSONG_OVER
marok: this particular case with overtime subsongs is quite ease, because these are unattractive and two of them also extremly short, but in general I think, not used subsongs in game should be considered to sap (this one title is delivered as an EXAMPLE ONLY).


Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_1.sap, Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_2.sap
Eventually can join specific sap but is rather questionable it is worth for.


Ducks_Ahoy.sap
Question about existing subsongs. MOVED INTO ASMA NOW.


Ducks_Ahoy.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
Alternative version.


Fidget.SUBSONGS_INCLUDE(1).sap
Alternative version with additional subsong (can eventually replace current asma-version)


Floyd_of_the_Jungle.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
Alternative versions.


Rescue_on_Fractalus.sap
Sap retracted.
In comparison with 'Composers\Langston_Peter\Behind_Jaggi_Lines.sap'
SONG 1 - the same but minimum louder.
SONG 2 - similar short melody but also bit lower toned.
SONG 3 - has not about two first seconds, beside it exactly same as.
Let me say it's 99%, 85%, 93% (overall 97%) identity.


Seahorses.ALL_SOUND.sap
Alternative version. Questionable subsongs.


Spark_Bugs.sap
Really bad.


Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.sap
ok?
