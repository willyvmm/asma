A music quality doubt.


000cff13.MMMG_soft_demo.#CENSORED#(Marek Goderski(MMMG),1992).cmc
I'm explaining used fraze #CENSORED# here - it's about original name of this module (very long, but what importante, highly controversial IMO).
This module (I don't know the reason, but I do wonder) is not able to be heared directly by ASAP as a regular cmc module (but CMC play it without problem).
Beside of those, a music quality doubt is signaled.

asma-anteroom\module\UNCERTAIN\David Spilka (Datri)\cmc\..
A shared uncertain for all files in the folder is similarity to ASMA sap (or any orginal music not sap'ed yet).
My propose (marok) is if similarity sap exists decide what to do next with the module - because that's not 'one way traffic', if it not exists it's more clear and the door to ASMA collection is basically open.

marok: I'd see this remix in ASMA (quite different than orginal and nice).

[marok: the clipped sound in saps with the extension (*_TIME_SHORT-WARNING) are solved and clean now (so they are now erased).]


Adalmar_*.sap
10 songs - all from conversion, I guess. Not sure all of them are worth to be included to the ASMA (due music quality compared to orginal and a significant size).


Arcade_Fruit_Machine.TIME_MISS.sap
ok?


Bugrunner.TIME_MISS.sap
Very quiet sound of music.
Play 2. or 3. subsong leads to play 1. subsong after it's end.


D-Bug.TIME_MISS.sap
it's too complicate for pure rip to me, main problem is i hear it's bit diffrent sounds than in game - flatter? - (i don't really know why)
beside subs.2&3 which are expected to sound diffrent (due $d20a in play)
subs.6-8 haven't detected in game and because music in the prod are composited i had to guess them (i have matched 5 components to 3 songs)


Desert_Falcon.sap
Question about existing subsongs.


Dr_Seuss.sap
Question about existing subsongs.


Dragonriders_of_Perm.sap, *.SUBSONGS_OVER(5,7,9).sap
Problem of subsongs not used in game at additional sap (*.SUBSONG_OVER)
marok: this particular case with overtime subsongs is quite ease, because these are unattractive and two of them also extremly short, but in general I think, not used subsongs in game should be considered to sap (this one title is delivered as an example only).


Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_1.sap, Drelbs.EXTRACT_SFX_2.sap
eventually can join specific sap but is rather questionable it is worth for.


Ducks_Ahoy.sap, Ducks_Ahoy.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
not sure which of these two choose to ASMA (short subsongs are doubtly interesting)


Fidget.SUBSONGS_INCLUDE(1).sap
alternative version with additional subsong (can eventually replace current asma-version)


Floyd_of_the_Jungle.sap, Floyd_of_the_Jungle.MUSIC_ONLY.sap
A waiting for decision of choise between versions.


Gangway.sap
Question about existing subsongs.


Ice.sap
A music quality doubt.


Into_the_Eagles_Nest.sap
A music quality doubt.


Jawbreaker.sap
Not too short nor fairly interesting?


Kangaroo.sap
Music's duration is very short, additional in the production there is one more if I'm correct (even shorter) piece of music (either not sfx) not contained in the sap.


Mission_die.sap
In the production this music sounds diffrent but is also quite buggy in my opinion (eg loop causes Async in melody by shifting two parts in relationship to each other).
In the sap it is corrected, but I must mention not all music is taken (I miss some).


Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles.sap
ok?
