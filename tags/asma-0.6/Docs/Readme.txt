 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is the pre-release testing version of the first Atari XL/XE chip-music
 collection. There is some kind of structure in the archive, anyway, it can
 change till the full version. The whole collection outfit was inspired by
 the HVSC collection (with some differences).

 For contributors
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you want to send me some tunes, they must be already converted to SAP
 format and should include all the information needed (author, name, date,
 number of songs). If you're unsure about any information needed, you can
 send me the music as well, maybe we can find the info together. If you don't
 know how to create SAP files, send me the binary file with the INIT and PLAY
 addresses and memory location where the tune has to be loaded. See SAP.TXT
 for SAP format description. And one more thing: we don't accept BASIC tunes,
 neither the compiled ones.
